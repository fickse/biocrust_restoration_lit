However, they are extremely sensitive to disturbance and attempts to facilitate their recovery have had variable success. In this study, we applied soil amendments designed to improve soil surface stability and accelerate biocrust recovery on an area disturbed by oil/gas exploration vehicles. Treatments included: (1) control (one time water only); (2) biocrust?only: biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (3) polyacrylamide gels (which are known to stabilize soils)?+?biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (4) gypsum + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; and (5) saline (NaCl) solution + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water. Only the NaCl treatment showed any effects on soil properties and these were only short term. These effects included an increase in soil strength and a reduction in soil aggregate stability, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kh), and cyanobacterial biomass. The inoculated biocrust material failed to develop and even after 10 years, there was only a very low natural recolonization of the plots. These results show that inoculating soils or applying these levels of soil amendments does not guarantee recovery of soil stability or biocrust, and that some sites are unlikely to recover without assistance. Thus, there is a need for more research into ways to enhance soil stability and identify the factors limiting biocrust establishment.",Colorado Plateau,-109.7341028,38.54486667,,,Field,10,Years,"Nutrients, Inoculum","Moss, Lichen, Cyanobacteria",Negative,,,"Chl a, Cover, Biomass (C), Penetrometer, hydraulic conductivity",,https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy34Rj9tRwFhF0zzWBf3wX9byPL87FBD9c5ZKbrGGQiY-GsA/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnucIiZ22vuG4DWlwBbFm_H6w3QZeNAy8jMXlBQZ45Tbrz-D0NiqwqlHekjs,,,

However, lichen symbiosis remains enigmatic, including the ability of a single fungal partner to associate with various algal partners. Psora decipiens is a characteristic lichen of biological soil crusts (BSCs), across semi-arid, temperate, and alpine biomes, which are particularly susceptible to habitat loss and climate change. The high levels of morphological variation found across the range of Psora decipiens may contribute to its ability to withstand environmental change. To investigate Psora decipiens acclimation potential, individuals were transplanted between four climatically distinct sites across a European latitudinal gradient for 2years. The effect of treatment was investigated through a morphological examination using light and SEM microscopy; 26S rDNA and rbcL gene analysis assessed site-specific relationships and lichen acclimation through photobiont switching. Initial analysis revealed that many samples had lost their algal layers. Although new growth was often determined, the algae were frequently found to have died without evidence of a new photobiont being incorporated into the thallus. Mycobiont analysis investigated diversity and determined that new growth was a part of the transplant, thus, revealing that four distinct fungal clades, closely linked to site, exist. Additionally, P.decipiens was found to associate with the green algal genus Myrmecia, with only two genetically distinct clades between the four sites. Our investigation has suggested that P.decipiens cannot acclimate to the substantial climatic variability across its environmental range. Additionally, the different geographical areas are home to genetically distinct and unique populations. The variation found within the genotypic and morpho-physiological traits of P.decipiens appears to have a climatic determinant, but this is not always reflected by the algal partner. Although photobiont switching occurs on an evolutionary scale, there is little evidence to suggest an active environmentally induced response. These results suggest that this species, and therefore, other lichen species, and BSC ecosystems themselves may be significantly vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss.","Climate Gradient, Europe",,,"16°28?E,9°48?E,12°51?E,2°26?W","56°32?N,50°01?N,47°05?N37°00?N",Field,2,Years,Inoculum source,Lichen,Mixed,Reciprocal transplant.

However, the recovery of lichen species affected by mining is rarely addressed in restoration projects. Here, we evaluate the translocation of Diploschistes diacapsis, a representative species of gypsum lichen communities affected by quarrying. We tested how a selection of adhesives could improve thallus attachment to the substrate and affect lichen vitality (as CO2 exchange and fluorescence) in rainfall-simulation and field experiments. Treatments included: white glue, water, hydroseeding stabiliser, gum arabic, synthetic resin, and a control with no adhesive. Attachment differed only in the field, where white glue and water performed best. Adhesives altered CO2 exchange and fluorescence yield. Notably, wet spoils allowed thalli to bind to the substrate after drying, revealing as the most suitable option for translocation. The satisfactory results applying water on gypsum spoils are encouraging to test this methodology with other lichen species. Implementing these measures in restoration projects would be relatively easy and cost-effective. It would help not only to recover lichen species in the disturbed areas but also to take advantage of an extremely valuable biological material that otherwise would be lost.","Granada, Spain",-3.75,37.03333333,,,Field,1,Years,Stabilizer,Lichen,Mixed,Water can be used to attach lichen to soil during transplant,Stabilizer,"Fluorescence, Survival","Successful survival (over control) for water, glue, and hydroseed",https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy34Rj9tRwFhF0zzWBf3wX9byPL87FBD9c5ZKbrGGQiY-GsA/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnuc8uytVVJD3QX_0sRx4MJvfNsvyHWpsBebT_xGNuAoT-cxDzx9rVFVCMuE,950,420,15

Soil moisture, total N, available N, and available P increased gradually with crust growth. Soil with crusts was wetter than the controlled naked sandy soil, and a significant correlation was observed between biomass and total nitrogen (r = 0.946, P = 0.015). Soil pH was lower than that of control. The scytonemin on the soil surface was exceptionally higher than the other pigments, and all the pigments were mainly distributed at the soil surface level.

To examine techniques for restoring biocrusts, we conducted a replicated, factorial experiment on recently abandoned road surfaces by applying biocrust inoculation (salvaged and stored dry for two years), salvaged topsoil, an abiotic soil amendment (wood shavings), and planting of a dominant perennial shrub (Ambrosia dumosa). Eighteen months after treatments, we measured biocrust abundance and species composition, soil chlorophyll a content and fertility, and soil resistance to erosion. Biocrust addition significantly accelerated biocrust recovery on disturbed soils, including increasing lichen and moss cover and cyanobacteria colonization. Compared to undisturbed controls, inoculated plots had similar lichen and moss composition, recovered 43% of total cyanobacteria density, had similar soil chlorophyll content, and exhibited recovery of soil fertility and soil stability. Inoculation was the only treatment that generated lichen and moss cover. Topsoil application resulted in partial recovery of the cyanobacteria community and soil properties. Compared to untreated disturbed plots, topsoil application without inoculum increased cyanobacteria density by 186% and moderately improved soil chlorophyll and ammonium content and soil stability. Topsoil application produced 22% and 51% of the cyanobacteria density g(-1) soil compared to undisturbed and inoculated plots, respectively. Plots not treated with either topsoil or inoculum had significantly lower cyanobacteria density, soil chlorophyll and ammonium concentrations, and significantly higher soil nitrate concentration. Wood shavings and Ambrosia had no influence on biocrust lichen and moss species recovery but did affect cyanobacteria composition and soil fertility. Inoculation of severely disturbed soil with native biocrusts rapidly restored biocrust communities and soil stability such that restored areas were similar to undisturbed desert within three years. Using salvaged biocrust as inoculum can be an effective tool in ecological restoration because of its efficacy and simple implementation.

To investigate the facilitating effects of cyanobacterial inoculation technology on the desertification control along this steppe-desert transition region, artificial cyanobacterial crusts were constructed with two filamentous cyanobacteria 3 and 8 years ago combined with Salix planting. The results showed that no crusts formed after 3 years of fixation only with Salix planting, whereas after cyanobacterial inoculation, the crusts formed quickly and gradually succeed to moss crusts. During that course, topsoil environments were gradually improved, providing the necessary material basis for the regeneration of vascular plants. In this investigation, total 27 species of vascular plants had regenerated in the experimental region, mainly belonging to Asteraceae, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Leguminosae. Using space time substitution, the dominant species along with the application of cyanobacterial inoculation technology succeeded from Agriophyllum squarrosum ultimately to Leymus chinensis.

However, establishment under varying field environmental conditions is understudied. We tested a variety of methods, arriving at a set of technical recommendations for rapid establishment of moss biocrusts on disturbed slopes, and the industrialization of this process.Methods In multiple field experiments, aimed at moss biocrust cultivation and establishment, we considered the following factors: nutrient solutions (control and weekly addition); water-retaining agent (control and addition); plant growth regulator (control and biweekly addition); shading (0, 50%, 70% and 90%); dispersal method (broadcast and spray application). In all cases, we initially inoculated soils with 700 g/m(2) of moss biocrust materials. We monitored dynamic changes of the coverage and density of moss biocrusts during the cultivation period, and their biomass at the end.Results We successfully cultured moss biocrusts in a field setting in as little as two months. Specifically, we found:(1) Regardless of the dispersal method, the nutrient solutions and some degree of shading both increased the coverage, plant density and biomass of moss biocrusts, whereas the water-retaining agent and plant growth regulator had little influence on these parameters. The shading treatments improved the survival rates of moss biocrusts, with the shade rating of 70% exhibiting the best performance. Further, the nutrient solutions had a more positive effect under shaded conditions. (2) The growth of mosses dispersed in the fall exceeded that of mosses dispersed in the summer. (3) Under both dispersal techniques, the maximal coverage of the moss biocrusts exceeded 90%, and the maximal plant density of moss biocrusts reached 120 stems/cm(2)under broadcast dispersal, and 150 stems/cm(2), under spray dispersal.Conclusions The rapid restoration of moss biocrusts can best be achieved by spray-dispersal or broadcast-dispersal, while also applying Hoagland solution to supply nutrients and maintaining soil moisture at 15-25%. Fall inoculation appears more likely to lead to better moss establishment, in fact, high moss mortality occurred in summer unless shading was used. We have some evidence, observational in fall, and experimental in summer, that moderate shading favors establishment. This technique could feasibly be up scaled and adopted to restore some ecological functions on various types of engineered disturbed surfaces.

Mosses are able to survive long dry periods, respond rapidly to precipitation, and reproduce vegetatively. With these qualities, drylandmosses have the potential to be an excellent dryland restoration material. Unfortunately, dryland mosses are often slow growing in nature, and ex situ cultivation methods are needed to enhance their utility. Our goal was to determine how to rapidly produce, vegetatively, Syntrichia caninervis and S. ruralis, common and abundant moss species in drylands of North America and elsewhere, in a greenhouse. We manipulated the length of hydration on a weekly schedule (5, 4, 3, or 2 days continuous hydration per week), crossed with fertilization (once at the beginning, monthly, biweekly, or not at all). Moss biomass increased sixfold for both species in 4 months, an increase that would require years under dryland field conditions. Both moss species preferred short hydration and monthly fertilizer. Remarkably, we also unintentionally cultured a variety of other important biocrust organisms, including cyanobacteria and lichens. In only 6 months, we produced functionally mature biocrusts, as evidenced by high productivity and ecosystem-relevant levels of N-2 fixation. Our results suggest that biocrust mossesmight be the ideal candidate for biocrust cultivation for restoration purposes.

Biocrusts help maintain soil fertility and reduce erosion. Because their loss through human activities has negative ecological and environmental health consequences, biocrust restoration is of interest. Active soil inoculation with biocrust microorganisms can be an important tool in this endeavor. We present a culture-independent, two-step process to grow multispecies biocrusts in open greenhouse nursery facilities, based on the inoculation of local soils with local biocrust remnants and incubation under seminatural conditions that maintain the essence of the habitat but lessen its harshness. In each of four U.S. Southwest sites, we tested and deployed combinations of factors that maximized growth (gauged as chlorophyll a content) while minimizing microbial community shifts (assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics), particularly for crust-forming cyanobacteria. Generally, doubling the frequency of natural wetting events, a 60% reduction in sunlight, and inoculation by slurry were optimal. Nutrient addition effects were site specific. In 4 months, our approach yielded crusts of high inoculum quality reared on local soil exposed to locally matched climates, acclimated to desiccation, and containing communities minimally shifted in composition from local ones. Our inoculum contained abundant crust-forming cyanobacteria and no significant numbers of allochthonous phototrophs, and it was sufficient to treat ca. 6,000 m(2) of degraded dryland soils at 1 to 5% of the typical crust biomass concentration, having started from a natural crust remnant as small as 6 to 30 cm(2).IMPORTANCE Soil surface crusts can protect dryland soils from erosion, but they are often negatively impacted by human activities. Their degradation causes a loss of fertility, increased production of fugitive dust and intensity of dust storms with associated traffic problems, and provokes general public health hazards. Our results constitute an advance in the quest to actively restore biological soil covers by providing a means to obtain high-quality inoculum within a reasonable time (a few months), thereby allowing land managers to recover essential, but damaged, ecosystem services in a sustainable, self-perpetuating way as provided by biocrust communities.",Multiple Locations,,,,,Greenhouse,5,Months,"Inoculum source, Watering Frequency, Nutrients, Shading, Delivery Method","Moss, Lichen, Cyanobacteria",Positive,,"Inoculum source, Watering Frequency, Nutrients, Shading, Delivery Method","Chl a, Biomass (C), microbial community structure","Variable by site, with water and shading helping across the board.

Cultivation of biocrust organisms is the first step in this process, and may benefit from harnessing species interactions. Species interactions are a dominant force structuring ecological communities. One key element of community structure, species richness, is itself important because it can promote the productivity of the entire community. Here, we use biological soil crusts as a model to test the effects of species interactions on production of biocrust materials for use in ecosystem rehabilitation. We screened eight different moss and lichen species from semiarid rangelands of Montana, USA, for growth potential under two watering regimes. Mosses generally grew well, but we were unable to cultivate the selected lichen species. We produced a >400% increase in the biomass of one species (Ceratodon purpureus). We tested whether a parasite-host relationship between two lichens could be used to enhance productivity of the parasite species, but this also resulted in no net gain of lichen productivity. Finally, we constructed all possible community combinations from a pool of five moss species to test for overyielding (community productivity exceeding that expected from the growth of community members in monoculture), and to determine both if, and the mode in which, species richness increases productivity. Polycultures yielded more than would be expected based upon the production of community constituents in monoculture. Using structural equation models, we determined that there was a modest effect of species richness on community productivity (r = 0.24-0.25), which was independent of a stronger effect of the identity of species in the community (r = 0.41-0.50).

At present, little is known regarding the cultivation of BSCs in the field due to lack of knowledge regarding the influencing factors that control BSCs growth. Thus, we determined the effects of various environmental factors (shade; watering; N, P, K, and Ca concentrations) on the growth of cyanobacteria-dominated BSCs from the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States. The soil surface changes and chlorophyll a concentrations were used as proxies of BSC growth and development. After 4 months, five factors were found to impact BSC growth with the following order of importance: NH4NO3 approximate to watering frequency>shading>CaCO3 approximate to KH2PO4. The soil water content was the primary positive factor affecting BSC growth, and BSCs that were watered every 5 days harbored greater biomass than those watered every 10 days. Groups that received NH4NO3 consistently exhibited poor growth, suggesting that fixed N amendment may suppress BSC growth. The effect of shading on the BSC biomass was inconsistent and depended on many factors including the soil water content and availability of nutrients.

However, the ability of artificially cultivated biocrusts to survive under adverse field conditions, including drought and heat stresses, is still relatively unknown. Mosses can bolster biocrust resistance to the stresses (e.g., drought and heat) and the resistance may be introduced prior to field cultivation. In this study, we subjected the well-developed artificial moss biocrusts (dominant species of Didymodon vinealis (Brid.) Zand.) that we cultivated in the phytotron to a dehydration-rehydration experiment and also a heat stress experiment and measured the activities of protective enzymes (including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)) and the contents of osmoregulatory substances (including soluble proteins and soluble sugars) and malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator of oxidative stress) in the stem and leaf fragments of mosses. The results showed that, during the dehydration process, the activities of protective enzymes and the contents of osmoregulatory substances and MDA gradually increased with increasing duration of drought stress (over 13 days). During the rehydration process, values of these parameters decreased rapidly after 1 d of rehydration. The values then showed a gradual decrease for 5 days, approaching to the control levels. Under heat stress (45A degrees C), the activities of protective enzymes and the content of soluble proteins increased rapidly within 2 h of heat exposure and then decreased gradually with increasing duration of heat exposure. In contrast, the contents of soluble sugars and MDA always increased gradually with increasing duration of heat exposure. This study indicates that artificial moss biocrusts possess a strong drought resistance and this resistance can be enhanced after a gradual dehydration treatment. This study also indicates that artificial moss biocrusts can only resist short-term heat stress (not long-term heat stress). These findings suggest that short-term heat stress or prolonged drought stress could be used to elevate the resistance of artificial moss biocrusts to adverse conditions prior to field reintroduction."," Shaanxi Province, China",109.2588889,36.79944444,,,Labratory,2,Weeks,"Watering Frequency, Temperature",Moss,Mixed,,"Watering Frequency, Temperature",chemistry,,https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy34Rj9tRwFhF0zzWBf3wX9byPL87FBD9c5ZKbrGGQiY-GsA/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnuexDv9af1numazoO7A2ikVX5iSkpKqDv-pALfdqvyRCzSmbGhfbV9w7ktc,,520,8.8

A desert moss Tortula desertorum (Broth.), the main component of biological soil crusts in the Gurbantunggut desert, was used to build a procedure for construction of moss-dominated crust. Micropropagation of desert mosses is a core technology to build biological soil crusts. Although the micropropagation of mosses has been extensively studied, little is known about that of desert mosses. Effects of media, explants, and culture temperature on regeneration potential of T. desertorum were investigated respectively in this study. The factors such as relative humidity, light intensity, and photoperiod, which might take an important role in the regeneration and development of the desert moss T. desertorum, were optimized through an orthogonal test design. The life cycle of the desert moss T. desertorum in cultivation was also investigated according to several factors affecting asexual reproduction. The results showed the explants cultivated with in situ soil had produced more protonema and shoots than those cultivated with other media. Detached leaves as explants yielded more biomass per gametophyte. It was found that a slightly higher temperature facilitated shoot growth. It should be pointed out that the favorable period for T. desertorum asexual reproduction occurred mainly in early summer, which contributes to the efficient protection of biological soil crusts.

More importantly, no negative effects of SA on the development and physiological activity of IBSCs were observed, and SA could facilitate the colonization and growth of cyanobacteria on sand. Moreover, the application of SA was much cheaper than the straw checkerboard barriers which are widely used in desertification control. This study suggests that SA can promote and accelerate the formation of BSCs; thus, it can be applied in IBSC technology to enhance the sand-stabilizing property of BSCs in the early stage.","Hobq Desert, Mongolia",109.8333333,40.36666667,,,Labratory,3,Months,Stabilizer,Cyanobacteria,Positive,"Interesting interactive effect, similar to what I observed.

Concurrent uninoculated controls served to monitor, and discount, natural inoculation by aeolian propagules.Results While the expansion front was highly variable in space, biocrusts expanded in the order of 2 cm month(-1), but only in seasons with moderate temperatures (Spring and Fall). Microcoleus vaginatus, Microcoleus steenstrupii, and Scytonema spp. advanced at averages of 1 cm month(-1), the crust advance front being preferentially driven by specialized propagules (hormogonia).

Following singular applications of chemicals, the mean weight diameter values of soil treated with TKS7 were 1.4-2.5 times higher than those of soil treated with PVA and thus TKS7 was selected for further tests for application with cyanobacteria (Nostoc Vaucher ex Bornet & Flahault, Phormidium Kutzing ex Gomont, and Scytonema arcangeli Bornet ex Flahault). Combined application of cyanobacteria and different concentrations of TKS7 enhanced soil aggregate stability, resulting in mean weight diameter values of 0.58-0.69mm and was comparable to TKS7 singular application (0.18-0.40mm). Surface hardness values were also highly improved by the combined application of cyanobacteria with TKS7 (4.5MPa) compared to singular treatment of cyanobacteria (2.3MPa). In addition, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) was applied as a water-holding material and nutrient supplement in soil. The SAP promoted cyanobacterial cell growth under dry conditions.

The effects of the artificial crusts on runoff and soil water content (0-90 cm) over eight years (2005-2012) were determined, depending on the differences between the artificial crusts and no crusts. The results showed that (I) artificial moss-dominated crusts primarily developed after two years and fully formed after four years in the semi-arid environment; (2) artificial crusts reduced runoff by 27% in total in the first three years after the inoculation; (3) artificial crusts decreased soil water content, and this effect increased linearly with time; and (4) artificial crusts increased water content in the upper 20 cm of soils but reduced water content in deeper (>30 cm) soils. The results indicate that it is feasible to artificially culture moss-dominated crusts in semi-arid regions. However, artificial crusts only slightly improved surface soil water conditions and greatly impaired deeper soil water conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It plays an important role in soil stability and artificial biocrust reconstruction in desert ecosystems. Previous studies have demonstrated that although artificial cultivation techniques can promote the micropropagation of S. caninervis, the resulting moss performs poorly in maintenance ability. Water availability has been considered as a critical factor to stimulate the physiological activities in moss species. Our objective in this study was to determine the optimum water condition for growth of sand-cultivated shoots of S. caninervis in the process of transplanting cultured materials from laboratory to the field.Methods We used sand-cultivated S. caninervis grown from fragmented gametophyte leaves and stems above ground. The experiment was run for 30 days under conditions of three water treatments, including intermittent water supply (watering every three days), fully watered (watering every day), and drought (watering every six days). Fluorescence and physiological indices of shoots, such as photochemical efficiency, pigment content, soluble sugar, free proline, soluble protein, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities and malondialdehyde were measured.Important findings The content of total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a and b in drought and fully watered treatments were significantly lower than in intermittent water supply treatment. Drought reduced the chlorophyll a/b ratio, and fully watered treatment deceased carotenoid content. Drought and fully watered treatments significantly reduced the maximal and actual photochemical efficiency and the soluble protein content, while increased most indices in osmotic adjustment substances and antioxidative enzyme activities, such as soluble sugar content, free proline content, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and malonaldehyde content. Our results showed that the sand-cultivated S. caninervis accumulated osmotic adjustment substances and strengthened the antioxidative enzyme activities to survive under different water conditions, such as in the fully watered treatment. Compared with the intermittent water supply treatment, drought may lead to more damages in sand-cultivated shoots of S. caninervis, with the membrane lipid peroxidation being aggravated. Thus, intermittent water supply results in better development of artificial-cultivated S. caninervis than drought and fully watered treatments. This conclusion could provide theoretical basis for water saving management of artificially cultivated bryophyte in wild engraftment.","Gurbantunggut Desert, China",,,,,Unclear,1,Weeks,Watering Frequency,Moss,Positive,,Watering Frequency,"Chl a, Cover, Fluorescence, Chemical composition",,https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy34Rj9tRwFhF0zzWBf3wX9byPL87FBD9c5ZKbrGGQiY-GsA/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnuc6kTQvfSSkhEiW84resfQj5OIXrYTN6uR4WqnoaEb1wpJrjztXLTxQzCk,,,

As a frequently used tool in grassland restoration, hay transfer is known to transfer cryptogam species. This might result in cryptogam stands differing from those achieved by natural succession. To assess hay transfer as a medium for cryptogam restoration, I analysed species composition of cryptogams in the hay of dry grasslands in Southern Germany, how fast they establish, and how fast they colonize adjacent plots. Cryptogam samples from hay showed species combinations similar to those of the mown sites and large shoot numbers to be present in the hay. Even low-growing and rare species were found in the hay. Hay receptor sites showed larger pleurocarpous moss and fruticose lichen patches than comparable sites without hay transfer, indicating earlier arrival of viable diaspores at the receptor sites. For acrocarpous mosses that colonize new sites by spores, no differences in turf size between succession and restoration plots were found. This shows that species transferred by hay have a distinct advantage over species that have to arrive at newly opened sites by natural means, i.e. many years later. The colonization from small restoration sites into adjacent areas without hay transfer proceeds with moderate speeds of about 1 to 2 m per year, probably with wind drift as the most important dispersal agent. Abundant cryptogam species including most pleurocarpous mosses and some Cladonia species rarely producing spores will be greatly enhanced by hay transfer. Nevertheless, the facilitation of pleurocarpous mosses may be detrimental to acrocarpous moss and epigaeic and saxicolous lichen species diversity, which should be considered in dry grassland restoration. I suggest a combination of different restoration measures in a mosaic pattern to create suitable conditions for a maximum of cryptogam species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that after the artificial inoculation of desert cyanobacteria, algal crusts were quickly formed, and in some microenvironments direct succession of the algal crusts to moss crusts occurred after 2-3 years. With the development and succession of biological soil crusts, the topsoil biomass, polysaccharides content, crust thickness and porosity increased, while the soil bulk density decreased. At the same time, with crust development and succession, the topsoil texture became finer and the percents of fine soil particles including silt and clay contents increased, while the percents of coarse soil particles (sand content) decreased proportionately. In addition, it was found that with crust development and succession, the water holding capacity and water content of topsoil showed an increasing trend, namely: moss crust > algal crusts > shifting sand. The water content (or water holding capacity) in algal and moss crusts were 1.1-1.3 and 1.8-2.2 times of those in shifting sand, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the water holding capacity and water content of topsoil were positively correlated with the crust biomass, polysaccharides content, thickness, bulk density, silt and clay content; while negatively correlated with the porosity and sand content. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis showed that the main factor affecting water content was the clay content, while that affecting water holding capacity was the porosity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They play multiple roles in the soil by fixing C and N and synthesizing exopolysaccharides, which increase soil fertility and water retention and improve soil structure and stability. Application of cyanobacteria as inoculants to promote biocrust development has been proposed as a novel biotechnological technique for restoring barren degraded areas and combating desertification processes in arid lands. However, previous to their widespread application under field conditions, research is needed to ensure the selection of the most suitable species. In this study, we inoculated two cyanobacterial species, Phormidium ambiguum (non N-fixing) and Scytonema javanicum (N-fixing), on different textured soils (from silt loam to sandy), and analyzed cyanobacteria biocrust development and evolution of physicochemical soil properties for 3 months under laboratory conditions. Cyanobacteria inoculation led to biocrust formation in all soil types. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed contrasting structure of the biocrust induced by the two cyanobacteria. The one from P. ambiguum was characterized by thin filaments that enveloped soil particles and created a dense, entangled network, while the one from S. javanicum consisted of thicker filaments that grouped as bunches in between soil particles. Biocrust development, assessed by chlorophyll a content and crust spectral properties, was higher in S. javanicum-inoculated soils compared to P. ambiguum-inoculated soils. Either cyanobacteria inoculation did not increase soil hydrophobicity. S. javanicum promoted a higher increase in total organic C and total N content, while P. ambiguum was more effective in increasing total exopolysaccharide (EPS) content and soil penetration resistance. The effects of cyanobacteria inoculation also differed among soil types and the highest improvement in soil fertility compared to non-inoculated soils was found in sandy and silty soils, which originally had lowest fertility.

Due to long recovery times following disturbance, there is a clear need for rehabilitation strategies to enhance the recovery of biocrust communities. Essential to biocrust recovery are exopolysaccharides (EPS): secretions comprised mainly of high molecular weight polymers that protect cyanobacteria from harsh environmental conditions. We examined whether biocrust rehabilitation strategies (inoculation in combination with surface shading and artificial soil stabilization) promote EPS production. To test if responses varied by soil texture, we measured biocrust recovery on two fine-textured soil types (clay and sandy clay loam) in a cool desert ecosystem. Shade coupled with inoculum addition resulted in the highest biocrust recovery, especially on clay soils. Independent of rehabilitation strategies, natural recovery of biocrusts occurred more rapidly on clay soils, reflected by greater increases in chlorophyll a (chl a). Chl a, a proxy for cyanobacterial biomass, was correlated to EPS amounts, suggesting that cyanobacteria are significant contributors to EPS production in biocrust development. Despite the role of EPS in biocrust establishment, EPS amounts had negligible effects on soil stability due inherent properties of fine soil texture.",Salt Lake Desert (UTTR),-113.5011778,41.10711111,,,Field,3,Years,"Inoculum, Shading, Stabilizer","Moss, Lichen, Cyanobacteria",Mixed,No difference from control.

Moss fragments were inoculated into a third warm dry setting, on bare soil in spring and fall, both with and without a jute net and with and without spring irrigation. Moss cover was monitored in spring seasons of three consecutive years. Both moss species increased in cover over the winter. When Bryum received spring irrigation that was out of sync with natural precipitation patterns, moss cover increased and then crashed, taking two seasons to recover. Syntrichia did not respond to the irrigation treatment. The addition of jute net increased moss cover under all conditions, except Syntrichia following fall inoculation, which required a second winter to increase in cover.

 oriented north-northwest to south-southeast in crusts. At sites in Needles (NDLS) and Island
 in the Sky (ISKY) districts of Canyonlands National Park, lichens were transplanted to
 NNW, SSE, ENE, WSW, and TOP pedicel faces and exposed to a full-factorial, randomized
 block experiment with four treatments: nutrient addition (P and K), soil stabilization with
 polyacrylamide resin (PAM), added cyanobacterial fiber, and biweekly watering.
 After 14.5 mo (NDLS) and 24 mo (ISKY), both visual rankings of lichen condition and
 measures of chlorophyll fluorescence were generally higher at ISKY than on more fertile
 but less stable soils at NDLS. On ENE and NNW pedicel faces, both these values and
 nitrogenase activity (NDLS only) exceeded corresponding values on WSW and SSE faces.
 Treatment effects were site specific and largely negative at NDLS; both nutrient and cy-
 anobacterial addition led to poorer lichen condition, and added nutrients led to reduced
 fluorescence. Responses to nutrients may have been mediated partly by disturbance of
 unstable soils and by competition with cyanobacteria.
 In a separate experiment investigating recruitment responses to adding fungal spores
 or Nostoc cells, rates of Collema establishment responded significantly to the former but
 not the latter. Low establishment overall suggests that natural recruitment may occur mainly
 from iscidia or thallus fragments, not spores.
 Measured simultaneously on artificial soil pedicels at NDLS and ISKY, both deposition
 and erosion declined at NDLS across the four pedicel microaspects as: WSW > SSE >
 NNW > ENE (or ENE > NNW), during fall and spring trials. Patterns were similar at
 ISKY, but WSW - SSE for spring deposition, and deposition did not differ by microaspect
 in fall. Greater deposition at ISKY, despite higher abundance of cyanobacteria, may be
 explained by stronger wind velocities.

In a growth chamber trial, Pure Nostoc commune culture, Dried Nostoc spp. and BSC slurries derived from mature soil crusts were applied with and without biochar to tailings. Arctic lupine had the highest biomass and all species except yellow mountain aven showed nitrogen fixation in tailings and mining impacted soils. Nodulation and nitrogen fixation only occurred in herbs given a Rhizobia inoculum, suggesting the use of nitrogen-fixing species in northern reclamation may require microbial amendments. When used in combination with Rhizobia inoculum, biochar may promote nitrogen fixation associated with herb species. BSC slurries from mature soil crusts had significantly higher mean rates of nitrogen fixation (95 ?mol N m2/hr) compared with other soil crust species (5–23 ?mol N m2/hr). Biochar, Rhizobial inoculants and native nitrogen fixing species can enhance revegetation and nitrogen input in northern mining impacted substrates. However, large scale field experiments are required to identify suitable landscapes and determine how these initial nitrogen fixing species influence subsequent succession.","Yukon, Canada",,,135°29' 76.1W,63°55' 26.4N,Labratory,101,Days,"Substrate, Biochar, Inoculum form (slurry vs dry), Inoculum Species","Moss, Lichen, Cyanobacteria",Positive,,Inoculum Species,N fixation,,,,,
60,2018,"Jones, TA",Ecosystem restoration: recent advances in theory and practice,The Rangeland Journal,,417–430,6,39,"Restoration of damaged ecosystems is receiving increasing attention worldwide as awareness increases that humanity must sustain ecosystem structure, functioning, and diversity for its own wellbeing. Restoration will become increasingly important because our planet will sustain an increasingly heavy human footprint as human populations continue to increase. Restoration efforts can improve desirable ecological functioning, even when restoration to a historic standard is not feasible with current practice. Debate as to whether restoration is feasible is coupled to long-standing disputes regarding the definition of restoration, whether more-damaged lands are worthy of restoration efforts given limited financial resources, and ongoing conflicts as to whether the novel ecosystem concept is a help or a hindrance to restoration efforts. A willingness to consider restoration options that have promise, yet would have previously been regarded as ‘taboo’ based on the precautionary principle, is increasing. Functional restoration is becoming more prominent in the scientific literature, as evidenced by an increased emphasis on functional traits, as opposed to a simple inventory of vascular plant species. Biodiversity continues to be important, but an increasingly expansive array of provenance options that are less stringent than the traditional ‘local is best’ is now being considered. Increased appreciation for soil health, plant–soil feedbacks, biological crusts, and water quality is evident. In the United States, restoration projects are becoming increasingly motivated by or tied to remediation of major environmental problems or recovery of fauna that are either charismatic, for example, the monarch butterfly, or deliver key ecosystem services, for example, hymenopteran pollinators.",,,,,,Review,,,,,,Review.

Therefore, in this study desert cyanobacterium Scytonema javanicum was cultivated in artificial synthetic wastewater to explore the feasibility of nutrient transferring from wastewater to desert. After inoculation, S. javanicum grew well in the wastewater; nitrogen and phosphorus were gradually removed from the wastewater. In general, cyanobacterial biomass, exopolysaccharide content, COD, nitrogen and phosphorus contents were all significantly affected by the cultivation time, wastewater dilution treatment and their interaction (P < 0.001). Comprehensively considering the producing period, biomass accumulation and nutrient removal efficiency, cultivation time of cyanobacterium S. javanicum in the synthetic wastewater should be controlled around 20 days, with wastewater dilution ratio at 1:1. Conclusively, desert cyanobacterium S. javanicum is a promising species for nutrient transferring from wastewater to desert, and its maximum biomass yield could reach 3.91 mg Chl-a L?1 in the synthetic wastewater.",Qubqi Desert,109 51?E,40 21?N,,,Labratory,30,Days,"Substrate, Time",Cyanobacteria,Positive,Substrate = dilutions of waste water,Substrate,"EPS, Chl a, Nutrients",,,,280 mm,
