However, lichen symbiosis remains enigmatic, including the ability of a single fungal partner to associate with various algal partners. Psora decipiens is a characteristic lichen of biological soil crusts (BSCs), across semi-arid, temperate, and alpine biomes, which are particularly susceptible to habitat loss and climate change. The high levels of morphological variation found across the range of Psora decipiens may contribute to its ability to withstand environmental change. To investigate Psora decipiens acclimation potential, individuals were transplanted between four climatically distinct sites across a European latitudinal gradient for 2years. The effect of treatment was investigated through a morphological examination using light and SEM microscopy; 26S rDNA and rbcL gene analysis assessed site-specific relationships and lichen acclimation through photobiont switching. Initial analysis revealed that many samples had lost their algal layers. Although new growth was often determined, the algae were frequently found to have died without evidence of a new photobiont being incorporated into the thallus. Mycobiont analysis investigated diversity and determined that new growth was a part of the transplant, thus, revealing that four distinct fungal clades, closely linked to site, exist. Additionally, P.decipiens was found to associate with the green algal genus Myrmecia, with only two genetically distinct clades between the four sites. Our investigation has suggested that P.decipiens cannot acclimate to the substantial climatic variability across its environmental range. Additionally, the different geographical areas are home to genetically distinct and unique populations. The variation found within the genotypic and morpho-physiological traits of P.decipiens appears to have a climatic determinant, but this is not always reflected by the algal partner. Although photobiont switching occurs on an evolutionary scale, there is little evidence to suggest an active environmentally induced response. These results suggest that this species, and therefore, other lichen species, and BSC ecosystems themselves may be significantly vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss.","Climate Gradient, Europe",9.170833333,51.21453704,"Field","Lichen",2,"Years","Inoculum source","Mixed","Inoculum source","Biomass (C)","","","","","16¯28?E,9¯48?E,12¯51?E,2¯26?W","56¯32?N,50¯01?N,47¯05?N37¯00?N","bib/williams_lichen_2017.bib"

However, they are extremely sensitive to disturbance and attempts to facilitate their recovery have had variable success. In this study, we applied soil amendments designed to improve soil surface stability and accelerate biocrust recovery on an area disturbed by oil/gas exploration vehicles. Treatments included: (1) control (one time water only); (2) biocrust?only: biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (3) polyacrylamide gels (which are known to stabilize soils)?+?biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (4) gypsum + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; and (5) saline (NaCl) solution + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water. Only the NaCl treatment showed any effects on soil properties and these were only short term. These effects included an increase in soil strength and a reduction in soil aggregate stability, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kh), and cyanobacterial biomass. The inoculated biocrust material failed to develop and even after 10ˇyears, there was only a very low natural recolonization of the plots. These results show that inoculating soils or applying these levels of soil amendments does not guarantee recovery of soil stability or biocrust, and that some sites are unlikely to recover without assistance. Thus, there is a need for more research into ways to enhance soil stability and identify the factors limiting biocrust establishment.","Colorado Plateau",-109.7341028,38.54486667,"Field","Moss, Lichen, Cyanobacteria",10,"Years","Nutrients, Inoculum","Negative","","Chl a, Cover, Biomass (C), Penetrometer, hydraulic conductivity","","","","","","","bib/chandler_amendments_2018.bib"

However, the recovery of lichen species affected by mining is rarely addressed in restoration projects. Here, we evaluate the translocation of Diploschistes diacapsis, a representative species of gypsum lichen communities affected by quarrying. We tested how a selection of adhesives could improve thallus attachment to the substrate and affect lichen vitality (as CO2 exchange and fluorescence) in rainfall-simulation and field experiments. Treatments included: white glue, water, hydroseeding stabiliser, gum arabic, synthetic resin, and a control with no adhesive. Attachment differed only in the field, where white glue and water performed best. Adhesives altered CO2 exchange and fluorescence yield. Notably, wet spoils allowed thalli to bind to the substrate after drying, revealing as the most suitable option for translocation. The satisfactory results applying water on gypsum spoils are encouraging to test this methodology with other lichen species. Implementing these measures in restoration projects would be relatively easy and cost-effective.

Given disturbances in the semiarid shrub steppe communities, we embarked on a set of studies to investigate restoration potential of mosses in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. We examined establishment and growth of two moss species common to the Great Basin, USA: Bryum argenteum and Syntrichia ruralis from two environmental settings (warm dry vs. cool moist). Moss fragments were inoculated into a third warm dry setting, on bare soil in spring and fall, both with and without a jute net and with and without spring irrigation. Moss cover was monitored in spring seasons of three consecutive years. Both moss species increased in cover over the winter. When Bryum received spring irrigation that was out of sync with natural precipitation patterns, moss cover increased and then crashed, taking two seasons to recover. Syntrichia did not respond to the irrigation treatment. The addition of jute net increased moss cover under all conditions, except Syntrichia following fall inoculation, which required a second winter to increase in cover. The warm dry population of Bryum combined with jute achieved on average 60% cover compared to the cool moist population that achieved only 28% cover by the end of the study. Differences were less pronounced for Syntrichia where moss from the warm dry population with jute achieved on average 51% cover compared to the cool moist population that achieved 43% cover by the end of the study. Restoration of arid land mosses may quickly protect soils from erosion while occupying sites before invasive plants. We show that higher moss cover will be achieved quickly with the addition of organic matter and when moss fragments originate from sites with a climate that is similar to that of the restoration site.","Great Basin",-118.5972463,43.56560185,"Field","Moss",3,"Years","Inoculum Species, Jute net, Watering, Climate, Season of Inoculation","Positive","Jute, Species, Climate, Time of Inoculation, Jute Net","Cover","","","","","121¯04?00.10?W, 116¯03?43.76?W, 118¯39?46.40?W","44¯43?36.54?N,43¯10?53.86?N,42¯47?18.10?N","bib/condon_filling_2016.bib"

 in the Sky (ISKY) districts of Canyonlands National Park, lichens were transplanted to
 NNW, SSE, ENE, WSW, and TOP pedicel faces and exposed to a full-factorial, randomized
 block experiment with four treatments: nutrient addition (P and K), soil stabilization with
 polyacrylamide resin (PAM), added cyanobacterial fiber, and biweekly watering.
 After 14.5 mo (NDLS) and 24 mo (ISKY), both visual rankings of lichen condition and
 measures of chlorophyll fluorescence were generally higher at ISKY than on more fertile
 but less stable soils at NDLS. On ENE and NNW pedicel faces, both these values and
 nitrogenase activity (NDLS only) exceeded corresponding values on WSW and SSE faces.
 Treatment effects were site specific and largely negative at NDLS; both nutrient and cy-
 anobacterial addition led to poorer lichen condition, and added nutrients led to reduced
 fluorescence. Responses to nutrients may have been mediated partly by disturbance of
 unstable soils and by competition with cyanobacteria.
 In a separate experiment investigating recruitment responses to adding fungal spores
 or Nostoc cells, rates of Collema establishment responded significantly to the former but
 not the latter. Low establishment overall suggests that natural recruitment may occur mainly
 from iscidia or thallus fragments, not spores.
 Measured simultaneously on artificial soil pedicels at NDLS and ISKY, both deposition
 and erosion declined at NDLS across the four pedicel microaspects as: WSW > SSE >
 NNW > ENE (or ENE > NNW), during fall and spring trials. Patterns were similar at
 ISKY, but WSW - SSE for spring deposition, and deposition did not differ by microaspect
 in fall. Greater deposition at ISKY, despite higher abundance of cyanobacteria, may be
 explained by stronger wind velocities.

To examine techniques for restoring biocrusts, we conducted a replicated, factorial experiment on recently abandoned road surfaces by applying biocrust inoculation (salvaged and stored dry for two years), salvaged topsoil, an abiotic soil amendment (wood shavings), and planting of a dominant perennial shrub (Ambrosia dumosa). Eighteen months after treatments, we measured biocrust abundance and species composition, soil chlorophyll a content and fertility, and soil resistance to erosion. Biocrust addition significantly accelerated biocrust recovery on disturbed soils, including increasing lichen and moss cover and cyanobacteria colonization. Compared to undisturbed controls, inoculated plots had similar lichen and moss composition, recovered 43% of total cyanobacteria density, had similar soil chlorophyll content, and exhibited recovery of soil fertility and soil stability. Inoculation was the only treatment that generated lichen and moss cover. Topsoil application resulted in partial recovery of the cyanobacteria community and soil properties. Compared to untreated disturbed plots, topsoil application without inoculum increased cyanobacteria density by 186% and moderately improved soil chlorophyll and ammonium content and soil stability. Topsoil application produced 22% and 51% of the cyanobacteria density g(-1) soil compared to undisturbed and inoculated plots, respectively. Plots not treated with either topsoil or inoculum had significantly lower cyanobacteria density, soil chlorophyll and ammonium concentrations, and significantly higher soil nitrate concentration. Wood shavings and Ambrosia had no influence on biocrust lichen and moss species recovery but did affect cyanobacteria composition and soil fertility. Inoculation of severely disturbed soil with native biocrusts rapidly restored biocrust communities and soil stability such that restored areas were similar to undisturbed desert within three years. Using salvaged biocrust as inoculum can be an effective tool in ecological restoration because of its efficacy and simple implementation.

In this investigation, total 27 species of vascular plants had regenerated in the experimental region, mainly belonging to Asteraceae, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Leguminosae. Using space time substitution, the dominant species along with the application of cyanobacterial inoculation technology succeeded from Agriophyllum squarrosum ultimately to Leymus chinensis. In addition, it was found that the shady side of the dunes is more conducive to crust development and succession of vegetation communities. Conclusively, our results indicate artificial cyanobacterial inoculation technology is an effective and desirable path for desertification control.","Qubqi Desert, Mongolia",109.85,40.35,"Field","Cyanobacteria",8,"Years","Plants","Positive","","Chl a, Biomass (C)","","1040","300","","","","bib/lan_artificially_2013.bib"

Due to long recovery times following disturbance, there is a clear need for rehabilitation strategies to enhance the recovery of biocrust communities. Essential to biocrust recovery are exopolysaccharides (EPS): secretions comprised mainly of high molecular weight polymers that protect cyanobacteria from harsh environmental conditions. We examined whether biocrust rehabilitation strategies (inoculation in combination with surface shading and artificial soil stabilization) promote EPS production. To test if responses varied by soil texture, we measured biocrust recovery on two fine-textured soil types (clay and sandy clay loam) in a cool desert ecosystem. Shade coupled with inoculum addition resulted in the highest biocrust recovery, especially on clay soils. Independent of rehabilitation strategies, natural recovery of biocrusts occurred more rapidly on clay soils, reflected by greater increases in chlorophyll a (chl a). Chl a, a proxy for cyanobacterial biomass, was correlated to EPS amounts, suggesting that cyanobacteria are significant contributors to EPS production in biocrust development. Despite the role of EPS in biocrust establishment, EPS amounts had negligible effects on soil stability due inherent properties of fine soil texture.","Salt Lake Desert (UTTR)",-113.5011778,41.10711111,"Field","Moss, Lichen, Cyanobacteria",3,"Years","Inoculum, Shading, Stabilizer","Mixed","","Chl a, EPS, Aggregate stability","No difference from control.

However, establishment under varying field environmental conditions is understudied. We tested a variety of methods, arriving at a set of technical recommendations for rapid establishment of moss biocrusts on disturbed slopes, and the industrialization of this process.Methods In multiple field experiments, aimed at moss biocrust cultivation and establishment, we considered the following factors: nutrient solutions (control and weekly addition); water-retaining agent (control and addition); plant growth regulator (control and biweekly addition); shading (0, 50%, 70% and 90%); dispersal method (broadcast and spray application). In all cases, we initially inoculated soils with 700 g/m(2) of moss biocrust materials. We monitored dynamic changes of the coverage and density of moss biocrusts during the cultivation period, and their biomass at the end.Results We successfully cultured moss biocrusts in a field setting in as little as two months. Specifically, we found:(1) Regardless of the dispersal method, the nutrient solutions and some degree of shading both increased the coverage, plant density and biomass of moss biocrusts, whereas the water-retaining agent and plant growth regulator had little influence on these parameters. The shading treatments improved the survival rates of moss biocrusts, with the shade rating of 70% exhibiting the best performance. Further, the nutrient solutions had a more positive effect under shaded conditions. (2) The growth of mosses dispersed in the fall exceeded that of mosses dispersed in the summer. (3) Under both dispersal techniques, the maximal coverage of the moss biocrusts exceeded 90%, and the maximal plant density of moss biocrusts reached 120 stems/cm(2)under broadcast dispersal, and 150 stems/cm(2), under spray dispersal.Conclusions The rapid restoration of moss biocrusts can best be achieved by spray-dispersal or broadcast-dispersal, while also applying Hoagland solution to supply nutrients and maintaining soil moisture at 15-25%. Fall inoculation appears more likely to lead to better moss establishment, in fact, high moss mortality occurred in summer unless shading was used. We have some evidence, observational in fall, and experimental in summer, that moderate shading favors establishment. This technique could feasibly be up scaled and adopted to restore some ecological functions on various types of engineered disturbed surfaces.

The key to the survival of biocrust is the versatility and adaptability of cyanobacteria and green algae. The organismal construct of the biocrust community is especially vulnerable to compressional forces, and is slow to recover without assistance. Given the importance of biocrusts to so many aspects of healthy ecosytem function, it would be advantageous if land managers prioritized restoring damaged biocrusts. Coastal sage scrub (CSS) is a unique and imperiled valuable habitat and is nearly unmatched in the biodiversity of unique plants and animals. Recent work in biocrust restoration finds that assisted restoration speeds recovery of functionality in biocrusts. At present, studies of biocrust restoration in CSS habitat do not exist. This study examines the feasibility of isolating and culturing a mix of endemic CSS cyanobacteria and green algae to inoculate native CSS soil, thereby facilitating recovery of disturbed biological soil crusts. It further looks at markers for culture growth, chlorophyll a, extractable polysaccharides, and stability, to gauge whether inoculation and growth of the culture have increased soil function. Growth of the mixed culture and increases in functionality are compared between autoclaved soil inoculations and native soil inoculations to determine the extent that native crust organisms can regrow without inoculation, and how the inoculum interacts with the native microbial community. A putative novel genus and species of cyanobacteria related to Leptolyngbya was isolated and tentatively included in the genus, Trichotorquatus. The mixed culture included a green algae, possibly a species of Trebouxia. Mixed inoculum added to native soil significantly increased chorophyll a levels and soil stability, and increased extractable polysaccharides after just two months, demonstrating recovery of function. Autoclaving soil reduced increases in functionality indicating the importance of the intact soil community for growth.

Active soil inoculation with biocrust microorganisms can be an important tool in this endeavor. We present a culture-independent, two-step process to grow multispecies biocrusts in open greenhouse nursery facilities, based on the inoculation of local soils with local biocrust remnants and incubation under seminatural conditions that maintain the essence of the habitat but lessen its harshness. In each of four U.S. Southwest sites, we tested and deployed combinations of factors that maximized growth (gauged as chlorophyll a content) while minimizing microbial community shifts (assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics), particularly for crust-forming cyanobacteria. Generally, doubling the frequency of natural wetting events, a 60% reduction in sunlight, and inoculation by slurry were optimal. Nutrient addition effects were site specific. In 4 months, our approach yielded crusts of high inoculum quality reared on local soil exposed to locally matched climates, acclimated to desiccation, and containing communities minimally shifted in composition from local ones.

Cultivation of biocrust organisms is the first step in this process, and may benefit from harnessing species interactions. Species interactions are a dominant force structuring ecological communities. One key element of community structure, species richness, is itself important because it can promote the productivity of the entire community. Here, we use biological soil crusts as a model to test the effects of species interactions on production of biocrust materials for use in ecosystem rehabilitation. We screened eight different moss and lichen species from semiarid rangelands of Montana, USA, for growth potential under two watering regimes. Mosses generally grew well, but we were unable to cultivate the selected lichen species. We produced a >400% increase in the biomass of one species (Ceratodon purpureus). We tested whether a parasite-host relationship between two lichens could be used to enhance productivity of the parasite species, but this also resulted in no net gain of lichen productivity. Finally, we constructed all possible community combinations from a pool of five moss species to test for overyielding (community productivity exceeding that expected from the growth of community members in monoculture), and to determine both if, and the mode in which, species richness increases productivity. Polycultures yielded more than would be expected based upon the production of community constituents in monoculture. Using structural equation models, we determined that there was a modest effect of species richness on community productivity (r = 0.24-0.25), which was independent of a stronger effect of the identity of species in the community (r = 0.41-0.50). These results will contribute to the optimization of biocrust cultivation, promoting the development of this emerging ecological rehabilitation technology.","Sapphire Mountains of Montana",-113.768,46.249,"Greenhouse","Moss",5,"Months","Inoculum species","Positive","Inoculum species","","","","325","","","","bib/bowker_applying_2017.bib"

Plant biomass yields with live inoculant generally were significantly greater than with the control treatment but were the same as with killed inoculant. Live algae plus P, K and S further enhanced productivity. P, K and S alone produced no increase over the control treatment. Response to the inoculant compared to the control appears to be a result of addition of nutrients present in the inoculant stock solution. Further biomass increases with the P, K and S plus live algae treatment compared to live and dead algae treatments occurred because these nutrients became limiting as N was added. Total organic-N and total C in surface soils were similar in all treatments.

When the stock solution was sampled via culture methods, the most prominent species found was Chlorella, a green alga.

However, the ability of artificially cultivated biocrusts to survive under adverse field conditions, including drought and heat stresses, is still relatively unknown. Mosses can bolster biocrust resistance to the stresses (e.g., drought and heat) and the resistance may be introduced prior to field cultivation. In this study, we subjected the well-developed artificial moss biocrusts (dominant species of Didymodon vinealis (Brid.) Zand.) that we cultivated in the phytotron to a dehydration-rehydration experiment and also a heat stress experiment and measured the activities of protective enzymes (including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)) and the contents of osmoregulatory substances (including soluble proteins and soluble sugars) and malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator of oxidative stress) in the stem and leaf fragments of mosses. The results showed that, during the dehydration process, the activities of protective enzymes and the contents of osmoregulatory substances and MDA gradually increased with increasing duration of drought stress (over 13 days). During the rehydration process, values of these parameters decreased rapidly after 1 d of rehydration. The values then showed a gradual decrease for 5 days, approaching to the control levels. Under heat stress (45A degrees C), the activities of protective enzymes and the content of soluble proteins increased rapidly within 2 h of heat exposure and then decreased gradually with increasing duration of heat exposure. In contrast, the contents of soluble sugars and MDA always increased gradually with increasing duration of heat exposure. This study indicates that artificial moss biocrusts possess a strong drought resistance and this resistance can be enhanced after a gradual dehydration treatment. This study also indicates that artificial moss biocrusts can only resist short-term heat stress (not long-term heat stress). These findings suggest that short-term heat stress or prolonged drought stress could be used to elevate the resistance of artificial moss biocrusts to adverse conditions prior to field reintroduction."," Shaanxi Province, China",109.2588889,36.79944444,"Labratory","Moss",2,"Weeks","Watering Frequency, Temperature","Mixed","Watering Frequency, Temperature","chemistry","","","520","8.8","","","bib/bu_successful_2017.bib"

The sand soil at the surface (Glade soil) was compared to a control soil (Pure sand) with limited impact of vegetation or organic matter, occurring at 50 cm depth beneath a glade area. To assess the influence of algae in the biological soil crust on the properties of pure sand, a coccal green alga (Choricystis minor), filamentous green alga (Klebsormidium subtile) and stramenopile alga (Tribonema minus) were isolated from the top layer of glade soil and grown in the lab in Petri dishes on sterile pure sand as monoalgal and bialgal (C. minor and K. subtile) crusts for 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 days. At the end of each growth stage, the hydrophysical parameters of crusted sand were estimated after drying at 50 ¯C for 15 h (equivalent to a 3-day hot spell) and compared to the parameters of pure sand. The hydrophysical parameters were substantially different between the two surfaces. The glade soil had an index of water repellency about 18-times that of pure sand and the persistence of water repellency almost 54-times that of pure sand. Both sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity in the glade soil were about 7% those of the pure sand, respectively. The growth of artificial algal crusts, characterized by an increase in organic carbon content from 0.16% to 0.33%, resulted in an increase in water drop penetration time of the dried crusts up to 14-times that of the pure sand and a decrease in the water sorptivity of the dried crusts up to 10% that of the pure sand. Whereas K. subtile crusts (both monoalgal and bialgal with C. minor) had up to a 9% decrease in hydraulic conductivity compared to pure sand, there was no impact of monoalgal C. minor and T. minus crusts on hydraulic conductivity. K. subtile was possibly limited to surface growth, whereas C. minor and T. minus penetrated to depth. Consequently, K. subtile may have clogged the top pores more effectively than the other two strains. The water repellency cessation time increased with an increase in water drop penetration time for all the dried monoalgal and bialgal crusts used in this study. A greater impact of K. subtile on the shifts in hydraulic behaviour could influence water capture and storage, potentially decreasing evaporation during dry periods, but enhancing overland flow diminishing leaching during wet periods.","Borsk† n°?ina lowland, Slovakia",16.99722222,48.61944444,"Labratory","Algae",21,"Days","Inoculum Species","Positive","Inoculation","Hydraulic conductivity, water repellency","","","","","16¯59?50?

We found that when M. vaginatus was absent in the BSC, the BSC coverage, quantified by the percentage of BSC area to total land surface area, was low with a chlorophyll a content of 4.77 x 10(-2) mg g(-1) dry soil, a thickness of 0.86 mm, and a compressive strength of 12.21 Pa. By increasing the percentage of M. vaginatus in the BSC, the BSC coverage, chlorophyll a content, crust thickness, and compressive strength all significantly increased (P < 0.01). The maximum chlorophyll a content (13.12 mg g(-1)dry soil), the highest crust thickness, and the compressive strength (1.48 mm and 36.60 Pa, respectively) occurred when the percentage of inoculated M. vaginatus reached 80% with a complex network of filaments under scanning electron microscope. The BSC quality indicated by the above variables, however, declined when the BSC was composed of pure M. vaginatus (monoculture). In addition, we found that secretion of filaments and polymer, which stick sands together in the BSC, increased remarkably with the increase of the dominant species until the percentage of M. vaginatus reached 80%. Our results suggest that not only the dominant species but also the accompanying taxa are critical for maintaining the structure and functions of the BSC and thus the stability of the BSC ecosystems.","Gurbantunggut Desert, China",88.23333333,44.58333333,"Labratory","Cyanobacteria",20,"Days","Inoculum species, Dosage","Positive","Inoculum species","Chl a, Biomass (C), SEM / Spectroscopy, Compressive Strength","","","79.5","10","","","bib/zheng_effects_2010.bib"

A desert moss Tortula desertorum (Broth.), the main component of biological soil crusts in the Gurbantunggut desert, was used to build a procedure for construction of moss-dominated crust. Micropropagation of desert mosses is a core technology to build biological soil crusts. Although the micropropagation of mosses has been extensively studied, little is known about that of desert mosses. Effects of media, explants, and culture temperature on regeneration potential of T. desertorum were investigated respectively in this study. The factors such as relative humidity, light intensity, and photoperiod, which might take an important role in the regeneration and development of the desert moss T. desertorum, were optimized through an orthogonal test design. The life cycle of the desert moss T. desertorum in cultivation was also investigated according to several factors affecting asexual reproduction. The results showed the explants cultivated with in situ soil had produced more protonema and shoots than those cultivated with other media. Detached leaves as explants yielded more biomass per gametophyte. It was found that a slightly higher temperature facilitated shoot growth. It should be pointed out that the favorable period for T. desertorum asexual reproduction occurred mainly in early summer, which contributes to the efficient protection of biological soil crusts. Based on the life cycle of T. desertorum in cultivation, a procedure for artificial reconstruction of moss-dominated soil crusts was established and assessed. A large number of protonema were induced to grow by breeding detached green leaves in agar-solid Knop medium after 1 month as day/night temperature and humidity were set at 20/10 degrees C and 60-85%, respectively. Moss-dominated crusts formed through transplanting protonema into sand supplemented with liquid Knop medium under day/night temperatures of 25/15 degrees C after another month.","Gurbantunggut desert, China",88.23333333,44.58333333,"Labratory","Moss",2,"Months","Substrate, Temperature, Shading, Plant parts","Positive","Substrate, Temperature, Shading","Biomass (C), SEM / Spectroscopy, shoot number","","","","","","","bib/NA.bib"

For arid and semi-arid lands, a well-developed cryptogamic crust may, in many cases, be an appropriate foundational material. The objective of this study was to incorporate cyanobacteria into a pelletized starch matrix for use as a soil inoculant in arid land rehabilitation. Two common terrestrial cyanobacteria, Nostoc punctiforme and Microcoleus vaginatus, were pelletized and monitored over an 8-week period (July to August, 1996). Escapability and viability of the pelletized cyanobacteria were tested using both chlorophyll a extraction and epiflourescence microscopy. Direct counts of populations and mean levels of chlorophyll a in both species steadily declined during the 8-week period. Results were poor and indicated this approach would be ineffective in the field. Dessication of the organisms during the pelletizing process may have been a prime reason for lack of success in this study.","Salt Lake Desert",-113,40.25,"Labratory","Cyanobacteria",8,"Weeks","Pelletization, Species","Negative","","Chl fluorescence, SEM","","","","","","","bib/howard_incorporation_1998.bib"

Therefore, development of biocrust inoculation technology for restoration is of interest. This requires knowledge of biocrust growth and dispersal. To contribute to this, we determined the speed at which biocrusts expand laterally based on the self-propelled motility of cyanobacteria.Methodology We inoculated sterile soil with natural biocrusts and incubated them over a year in a greenhouse under conditions mimicking local precipitation, monitoring the crust's lateral expansion using time-course photography, chlorophyll a content, and microscopic inspection. Concurrent uninoculated controls served to monitor, and discount, natural inoculation by aeolian propagules.Results While the expansion front was highly variable in space, biocrusts expanded in the order of 2 cm month(-1), but only in seasons with moderate temperatures (Spring and Fall). Microcoleus vaginatus, Microcoleus steenstrupii, and Scytonema spp. advanced at averages of 1 cm month(-1), the crust advance front being preferentially driven by specialized propagules (hormogonia). These rates are within expectations based on instantaneous gliding motility speeds of cyanobacteria.Conclusions Based on the expansion capability of biocrusts during growth seasons, greenhouse inoculum units can be optimally spaced to fill 4-8 cm gaps.","Sonoran",-111.3539764,33.3923072,"Labratory","Cyanobacteria",3,"Months","Inoculum source","Positive","Inoculum species","Chl a, Cover","","","","","","","bib/sorochkina_establishing_2018.bib"

They play multiple roles in the soil by fixing C and N and synthesizing exopolysaccharides, which increase soil fertility and water retention and improve soil structure and stability. Application of cyanobacteria as inoculants to promote biocrust development has been proposed as a novel biotechnological technique for restoring barren degraded areas and combating desertification processes in arid lands. However, previous to their widespread application under field conditions, research is needed to ensure the selection of the most suitable species. In this study, we inoculated two cyanobacterial species, Phormidium ambiguum (non N-fixing) and Scytonema javanicum (N-fixing), on different textured soils (from silt loam to sandy), and analyzed cyanobacteria biocrust development and evolution of physicochemical soil properties for 3 months under laboratory conditions. Cyanobacteria inoculation led to biocrust formation in all soil types. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed contrasting structure of the biocrust induced by the two cyanobacteria. The one from P. ambiguum was characterized by thin filaments that enveloped soil particles and created a dense, entangled network, while the one from S. javanicum consisted of thicker filaments that grouped as bunches in between soil particles. Biocrust development, assessed by chlorophyll a content and crust spectral properties, was higher in S. javanicum-inoculated soils compared to P. ambiguum-inoculated soils. Either cyanobacteria inoculation did not increase soil hydrophobicity. S. javanicum promoted a higher increase in total organic C and total N content, while P. ambiguum was more effective in increasing total exopolysaccharide (EPS) content and soil penetration resistance. The effects of cyanobacteria inoculation also differed among soil types and the highest improvement in soil fertility compared to non-inoculated soils was found in sandy and silty soils, which originally had lowest fertility. On the whole, the improvement in soil fertility and stability supports the viability of using cyanobacteria to restore degraded arid soils.","Tabernas Desert",-2.443611111,37.01027778,"Labratory","Cyanobacteria",3,"Months","Substrate, Inoculum Species","Positive","Time, Substrate, Species","","","","","","2¯26?37??W","37¯00?37??N","bib/chamizo_cyanobacteria_2018.bib"

Following singular applications of chemicals, the mean weight diameter values of soil treated with TKS7 were 1.4-2.5 times higher than those of soil treated with PVA and thus TKS7 was selected for further tests for application with cyanobacteria (Nostoc Vaucher ex Bornet & Flahault, Phormidium Kutzing ex Gomont, and Scytonema arcangeli Bornet ex Flahault). Combined application of cyanobacteria and different concentrations of TKS7 enhanced soil aggregate stability, resulting in mean weight diameter values of 0.58-0.69mm and was comparable to TKS7 singular application (0.18-0.40mm). Surface hardness values were also highly improved by the combined application of cyanobacteria with TKS7 (4.5MPa) compared to singular treatment of cyanobacteria (2.3MPa). In addition, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) was applied as a water-holding material and nutrient supplement in soil. The SAP promoted cyanobacterial cell growth under dry conditions. Chlorophyll a content of soil was improved by the addition of SAP (CST1: 2.93 mu g g(-1)) compared to singular treatment of cyanobacteria (C: 2.25 mu g g(-1)).

Aggregate stability of the combined biological and chemical treatment (ACSAP) was higher than that of samples treated with Nostoc cells alone (AC) in the fast and slow wetting tests, but less stable than that of AC treatment in the wet stirring test. The SAP showed no harmful effect on Nostoc cell growth because of increased biomass during ACSAP treatment. However, the levels of extracellular polysaccharides (ESP) were lower upon ACSAP treatment than AC treatment. The wet stirring test demonstrated that ESP content was more important than cyanobacterial biomass for maintaining stability of the induced BSC. Overall, this study provides useful information regarding the interaction of Nostoc cells and superabsorbent polymer during artificial BSC formation.

Net CO2 exchange rate increased when biological crusts were inoculated as slurry and the microcosms were watered five times per week. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints and phylogenetic analyses indicated that most of the cyanobacterial species already present in the inoculated crust had the capability to spread and colonize the surface of the surrounding soil. These analyses showed that cyanobacterial communities were less diverse when the microcosms were watered five times per week, and that watering frequency (followed in importance by the addition of composted sewage sludge and inoculation type) was the treatment that most strongly influenced their composition.

Artificial propagation of crusts is one way to restore degraded desert soils. However, little is known about their effectiveness on overland flow or water infiltration. Consequently, a study was done on soils of the Loess Plateau of China that had crusts propagated on different slopes. The results show that: (1) it is feasible to artificially grow moss-dominated biological soil crusts (moss crusts) in laboratory; when inoculated by sprinkling crushed fragments of stems and leaves of natural moss crusts they will cover the soil surface almost completely after about 10 months; (2) the artificially propagated moss crusts significantly increase infiltration consequently decreasing overland flow and this increase in infiltration is positively correlated to the soil coverage extent; (3) overland flow results increased by slope in moss-protected and bare soils, consequently the action of moss crusts is particularly important for protecting steep slopes; (4) the start time of runoff process is delayed by moss crusts, and the soil water redistribution process is also greatly affected.

The effects of the artificial crusts on runoff and soil water content (0-90 cm) over eight years (2005-2012) were determined, depending on the differences between the artificial crusts and no crusts.

However, when the algal biomass decreased, the compressive strength did not descend immediately, but remained relatively steady. The higher the algal biomass became, the thicker were the algal crusts formed. Given the same biomass, the highest compressive strength of man-made algal crusts in fields was found at an algal ratio of 62.5% M. vaginatus, 31.25% P. tenue and 6.25% S. javanicum, and it reached 0.89 kg cm2 .

Restoration will become increasingly important because our planet will sustain an increasingly heavy human footprint as human populations continue to increase. Restoration efforts can improve desirable ecological functioning, even when restoration to a historic standard is not feasible with current practice. Debate as to whether restoration is feasible is coupled to long-standing disputes regarding the definition of restoration, whether more-damaged lands are worthy of restoration efforts given limited financial resources, and ongoing conflicts as to whether the novel ecosystem concept is a help or a hindrance to restoration efforts. A willingness to consider restoration options that have promise, yet would have previously been regarded as ?taboo? based on the precautionary principle, is increasing. Functional restoration is becoming more prominent in the scientific literature, as evidenced by an increased emphasis on functional traits, as opposed to a simple inventory of vascular plant species. Biodiversity continues to be important, but an increasingly expansive array of provenance options that are less stringent than the traditional ?local is best? is now being considered. Increased appreciation for soil health, plant?soil feedbacks, biological crusts, and water quality is evident. In the United States, restoration projects are becoming increasingly motivated by or tied to remediation of major environmental problems or recovery of fauna that are either charismatic, for example, the monarch butterfly, or deliver key ecosystem services, for example, hymenopteran pollinators.","",NA,NA,"Review","",NA,"","","","","","Review.

It plays an important role in soil stability and artificial biocrust reconstruction in desert ecosystems. Previous studies have demonstrated that although artificial cultivation techniques can promote the micropropagation of S. caninervis, the resulting moss performs poorly in maintenance ability. Water availability has been considered as a critical factor to stimulate the physiological activities in moss species. Our objective in this study was to determine the optimum water condition for growth of sand-cultivated shoots of S. caninervis in the process of transplanting cultured materials from laboratory to the field.Methods We used sand-cultivated S. caninervis grown from fragmented gametophyte leaves and stems above ground. The experiment was run for 30 days under conditions of three water treatments, including intermittent water supply (watering every three days), fully watered (watering every day), and drought (watering every six days). Fluorescence and physiological indices of shoots, such as photochemical efficiency, pigment content, soluble sugar, free proline, soluble protein, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities and malondialdehyde were measured.Important findings The content of total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a and b in drought and fully watered treatments were significantly lower than in intermittent water supply treatment. Drought reduced the chlorophyll a/b ratio, and fully watered treatment deceased carotenoid content. Drought and fully watered treatments significantly reduced the maximal and actual photochemical efficiency and the soluble protein content, while increased most indices in osmotic adjustment substances and antioxidative enzyme activities, such as soluble sugar content, free proline content, catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and malonaldehyde content. Our results showed that the sand-cultivated S. caninervis accumulated osmotic adjustment substances and strengthened the antioxidative enzyme activities to survive under different water conditions, such as in the fully watered treatment. Compared with the intermittent water supply treatment, drought may lead to more damages in sand-cultivated shoots of S. caninervis, with the membrane lipid peroxidation being aggravated. Thus, intermittent water supply results in better development of artificial-cultivated S. caninervis than drought and fully watered treatments. This conclusion could provide theoretical basis for water saving management of artificially cultivated bryophyte in wild engraftment.","Gurbantunggut Desert, China",NA,NA,"Unclear","Moss",1,"Weeks","Watering Frequency","Positive","Watering Frequency","Chl a, Cover, Fluorescence, Chemical composition","","","","","","","bib/hong-mei_effects_2017.bib"

As a frequently used tool in grassland restoration, hay transfer is known to transfer cryptogam species. This might result in cryptogam stands differing from those achieved by natural succession. To assess hay transfer as a medium for cryptogam restoration, I analysed species composition of cryptogams in the hay of dry grasslands in Southern Germany, how fast they establish, and how fast they colonize adjacent plots. Cryptogam samples from hay showed species combinations similar to those of the mown sites and large shoot numbers to be present in the hay. Even low-growing and rare species were found in the hay. Hay receptor sites showed larger pleurocarpous moss and fruticose lichen patches than comparable sites without hay transfer, indicating earlier arrival of viable diaspores at the receptor sites. For acrocarpous mosses that colonize new sites by spores, no differences in turf size between succession and restoration plots were found. This shows that species transferred by hay have a distinct advantage over species that have to arrive at newly opened sites by natural means, i.e. many years later. The colonization from small restoration sites into adjacent areas without hay transfer proceeds with moderate speeds of about 1 to 2 m per year, probably with wind drift as the most important dispersal agent. Abundant cryptogam species including most pleurocarpous mosses and some Cladonia species rarely producing spores will be greatly enhanced by hay transfer. Nevertheless, the facilitation of pleurocarpous mosses may be detrimental to acrocarpous moss and epigaeic and saxicolous lichen species diversity, which should be considered in dry grassland restoration. I suggest a combination of different restoration measures in a mosaic pattern to create suitable conditions for a maximum of cryptogam species.","",NA,NA,"","",NA,"","","","","","","","","","","","bib/jeschke_cryptogams_2012.bib"

The results showed that after the artificial inoculation of desert cyanobacteria, algal crusts were quickly formed, and in some microenvironments direct succession of the algal crusts to moss crusts occurred after 2-3 years. With the development and succession of biological soil crusts, the topsoil biomass, polysaccharides content, crust thickness and porosity increased, while the soil bulk density decreased. At the same time, with crust development and succession, the topsoil texture became finer and the percents of fine soil particles including silt and clay contents increased, while the percents of coarse soil particles (sand content) decreased proportionately. In addition, it was found that with crust development and succession, the water holding capacity and water content of topsoil showed an increasing trend, namely: moss crust > algal crusts > shifting sand. The water content (or water holding capacity) in algal and moss crusts were 1.1-1.3 and 1.8-2.2 times of those in shifting sand, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the water holding capacity and water content of topsoil were positively correlated with the crust biomass, polysaccharides content, thickness, bulk density, silt and clay content; while negatively correlated with the porosity and sand content. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis showed that the main factor affecting water content was the clay content, while that affecting water holding capacity was the porosity.","",NA,NA,"","",NA,"","","","","","","","","","","","bib/wu_development_2014.bib"

By studying the optimal medium condition of beef extract 3 g/l, peptone 10 g/l, maltose 40 g/l, and NaCl 4g/l we observed that the optimal medium condition was pH 6.0, incolum size 8%, liquid volume 40 ml in 200 ml flak and temperature 28 degrees C. The maximum EPS production was 20.19 g/l which is about five times more than that at the basal condition. Furthermore, results obtained indicated that the flocculation activity of the extracellular polymer can be achieved at over 80.4% in kaolin suspension and this occurred at a concentration of 0.4 mg/l. This paper describes the optimum condition of exopolysaccharides production by Bacillus thuringiensis 27 and showed that exopolysaccharides had high bioflocculant activity. This work provides a scientific foundation to explore new exopolysaccharides and bioflocculation in sand biological soil crusts.
